# Vulnerability-Analysis

Vulnerability Analysis Project



Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the vulnerability assessment of a simulated company, specifically a GP (General Practice) clinic with branches across London, United Kingdom. This repository contains a scenario-based lab report through a HTML document that focuses on evaluating the security's architecture and design of the simulated website whilst identifying means to enhance  security and examine cryptography protocols and vulnerabilities.

How to Use
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is not intended for practical use but serves as a demonstration of cybersecurity assessment methodologies. Please note that the simulated company and its vulnerabilities are entirely fictional.

Feel free to explore the provided lab reports and findings in the docs directory to understand the simulated vulnerabilities and recommended mitigation strategies.
