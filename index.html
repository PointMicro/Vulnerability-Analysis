            <h2>Scenario Section</h2>
            <p>Our independent business with a was hired by a major GP and hospital branches that are spread across many different locations in the UK. 
                They had tasked us to develop secure database system, secure websites and applications along with providing a series of penetration tests 
                to identify any vulnerabilities in the database. This is due to the fact that the GP firm requires an advanced system to store and manage 
                their patient data such as pefrsonal and medical information. We have collaborated with the firm by creating a website called https://cwscenario.site 
                which allows patients to log in and view their health records and even book appointments without having to call the firm. As this is a major health firm, 
                many patientsâ€™ data will be stored on the database along with general information of the staff which is to be linked with the booking system.</p>

                    <p>In order identify the security weakness in our database systems, we would need to complete information gathering tasks such as OSINT,
                         Reconnaissance and Port Scanning / Enumeration</p>
